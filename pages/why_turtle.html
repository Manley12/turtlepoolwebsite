<h2>Why TurtleCoin?</h2>

<br />

<h5>Turtlecoin:</h5>
<p>
    Launched on December 9, 2017 as an open source, community-driven coin. The community is open and accessible, and it's a fun coin to mine. Rather than Bitcoin (cappped at 21 Million) or Ethereum (uncapped) Turtle decided to cap at 1 TRILLION coins.

    This pool is owned by @papacabeza and managed by @thedepressor. Our collaborationn began on the <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/388915017187328002/401456460397150210">Turtlecoin Discord channel</a> and our collaboration agreement was paid for in Turtle.

<h5>Why are we building a Turtlecoin pool?</h5>
<p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>
            <b>Turtlecoin is truly community driven.</b> 
            Turtlecoin isn't a security, and is demonstrating that it has utility. The "TurtleCoin" is merely a program running on the TRTL Network. TRTL propels things like smart contracts on the TRTLE sidechain, similiar to ETH. Turtle's community-driven mission will reduce that risk. [See the Medium <a href="https://medium.com/@turtlecoin">installments</a> and Discord <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/388915017187328002/401456460397150210">channel</a>]
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Strong lead developer.</b>
            The success of some of the most important open-source-like-projects depends on a strong community and an even stronger, charismatic (sometimes maniacal) vision-driven lead developer. Examples: Linus Torvalds + Linux; or Jimmy Wales + Wikipedia; or Craig Newmark + Craigslist. The TurtleCoin lead, @RockSteady has that character. [See <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/388915017187328002/401456460397150210">Cathedral and the Bazaar</a>, the basis for this criterion].
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>ASIC resistance.</b>
            Turtle is commited to mining decentralization and has already forked it’s code in order to avoid ASIC takeover of the algo. [See <a href="https://medium.com/@turtlecoin/what-is-the-deal-with-asic-d22b86510c6">this Medium article</a> explaining the philosophy].
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Follow the leaders.</b>
                Turtle has strong early support from some key figures in crypto, and they’ve endorsed it with no quid pro quo, no bounty. [See Kevin Rose’s <a href="http://www.blockzero.show/7ffca55a">podcast</a>]

<h5>Why join our pool?</h5>
<p>
    We teamed up to build one of the most reliable pools we could think of so that we had a pool that we’d send family and friends to have their first mining experience on. Our pool is built on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) infrastructure and it can handle virtually any bandwidth and has the same level of DDoS protection as Google itself, as such we charge a 2% fee.
