<h2>Turtle Pool Support</h2>

<br />

<h5>Where:</h5>
<p>
    We do it all on Discord: <a href="">PSR CRYPTO Discord</a>.
</p>

<br />

<h5>Hours of Operation:</h5>
<p>
    Please remember that although we receive a small fee, we are volunteers with jobs and daytime responsibilities that we prioritize. We'll endeavor to respond to any support tickets within 24 hours. We ask for your short-term patience in exchange for a long-term commitment.
</p>

<br />

<h5>Commitment:</h5>
<p>
    Our plan is to run our pool for one year, through June 30, 2019. The Internet is full of aspirations like that so take this one for what it's worth, it's not a guarantee but it's our plan of record. If you're like many miners in the decentralized world and are looking to "set &#38 forget" your rigs, then welcome home, that's exactly why we built the pool for our use.
</p>

<br />

<h5>Infrastructure:</h5>
<p>
    Although there can be software hiccups, the infrastructure is pretty solid, and we're banking on little support needed in this case. We run our pool on Google Cloud Platform and it's products. Our Turtle Pool is build on Google Compute Engine, which offers a Service Level Objective of 99.99%. Additionally, the DDoS protection of GCP means our pool has the same thick shell for DDoS that Google, itself, uses. 
</p>

<br />

<h5>Pool Location:</h5>
<p>
    Although the gateways to GCP infrastructure are global, we chos to run our Pool on GCP infrastructure in Oregon. We chose this location because it had the lowest latency for users in Silicon Valley.
