Venetia Monitor -- Venetian Blind effect (or crappy monitor font) --
In Macintosh & Windows TrueType.

VenetiaMonitor - A quasi-retro style font (Fixed width).
I say it's a quasi-retro font because it doe's look like it belongs on some long forgotten 8 bit computer of yore, but
kind of looks 'recent' for some unexplained reason (any ideas why ?!).

I did this font after watching the opening  sequence from 'The Bill' on TV on evening and seeing the'interlaced'
monitors displaying this kind of 'font'...

This font contains the full Upper & Lower case sets, numerals and punctuation. Again, no European chars, sorry!
